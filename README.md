## [Project 1: NIST Cybersecurity Framework to respond to a security incident: Project Overview](https://github.com/ashire6456/CyberSecurity-Portofolio/blob/main/File%20permissions%20in%20Linux.txt)
1. #### Incident.
One of our client that works a multimedia company that offers web design services, graphic design, and social media marketing solutions to small businesses. 
The organization recently experienced a DDoS attack, which compromised the internal network for two hours until it was resolved.

2. #### CyberSecurity team findings.
The cybersecurity team then investigated the security event. They found that a malicious actor had sent a flood of ICMP pings into the company’s network through an unconfigured firewall. This vulnerability allowed the malicious attacker to overwhelm the company’s network through a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. 

3. #### Solution
To address this security event, the network security team implemented: 

- A new firewall rule to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets

- Source IP address verification on the firewall to check for spoofed IP addresses on incoming ICMP packets

- Network monitoring software to detect abnormal traffic patterns

- An IDS/IPS system to filter out some ICMP traffic based on suspicious characteristics
