## [Project 1: Incident handler's journal entry : Project Overview](https://github.com/ashire6456/CyberSecurity-Portofolio/blob/main/Vulnerability%20assessment%20report%20.pdf)
A small U.S. health care clinic specializing in delivering primary-care services experienced a security incident on a Tuesday morning, at approximately 9:00 a.m. Several employees reported that they were unable to use their computers to access files like medical records. Business operations shut down because employees were unable to access the files and software needed to do their job.

- Implementing of authentication, authorization and auditing mechanism.
- Using strong passwords, role-based access control and MFA.
- Encryption of data in transit using TLS.
## [Project 2: Analyze a vulnerable system: Project Overview](https://github.com/ashire6456/CyberSecurity-Portofolio/blob/main/Vulnerability%20assessment%20report%20.pdf)
The company stores information on a remote database server, since many of the employees work remotely from locations all around the world. Employees of the company regularly query, or request, data from the server to find potential customers. The database has been open to the public since the company's launch three years ago. As a cybersecurity professional, I recognize that keeping the database server open to the public is a serious vulnerability.
##### Remediation Strategy
- Implementing of authentication, authorization and auditing mechanism.
- Using strong passwords, role-based access control and MFA.
- Encryption of data in transit using TLS.


## [Project 3: Apply filters to SQL queries: Project Overview](https://github.com/ashire6456/CyberSecurity-Portofolio/blob/main/Apply%20filters%20to%20SQL%20queries.pdf)
My organization is working to make their system more secure. It is my job to ensure the system is safe, investigate all potential security issues, and update employee computers as needed. The following steps provide examples of how I used SQL with filters to perform security-related tasks.

- Retrieve after hours failed login attempts.
- Retrieve login attempts on specific dates.
- Retrieve login attempts outside of Mexico.
- Retrieve employees in Marketing.
- Retrieve employees in Finance or Sales.
- Retrieve all employees not in IT.
## [Project 4: Managing File permission using Linux: Project Overview](https://github.com/ashire6456/CyberSecurity-Portofolio/blob/main/File%20permissions%20in%20Linux.pdf)
Project description
The research team at my organization needs to update the file permissions for certain files and directories within the projects directory. The permissions do not currently reflect the level of authorization that should be given. Checking and updating these permissions will help keep their system secure.

- How to determine the existing permissions set for a specific directory in the file system.
- Denying write permission to all three levels user, group and other.
- Granting user and group read permission to archived project_x.txt.
- Giving full access researcher2 user over the draft directory and its content.
  
## [Project 5: NIST Cybersecurity Framework to respond to a security incident: Project Overview](https://github.com/ashire6456/CyberSecurity-Portofolio/blob/main/Incident%20report%20analysis%20.pdf)

One of our client that works a multimedia company that offers web design services, graphic design, and social media marketing solutions to small businesses. 
The organization recently experienced a DDoS attack, which compromised the internal network for two hours until it was resolved.
  To address this security event, the network security team implemented: 

- A new firewall rule to limit the rate of incoming ICMP packets

- Source IP address verification on the firewall to check for spoofed IP addresses on incoming ICMP packets

- Network monitoring software to detect abnormal traffic patterns

- An IDS/IPS system to filter out some ICMP traffic based on suspicious characteristics
