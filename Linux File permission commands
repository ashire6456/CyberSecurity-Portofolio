Introduction
In this session, we will use Linux commands to configure authorization.

Authorization is the concept of granting access to specific resources in a system. 
It's important because without authorization any user could access and modify all files belonging to other users or system files. 
This would certainly be a security risk.

Scenario

In this scenario, you must examine and manage the permissions on the files in the /home/researcher2/projects directory for the researcher2 user.

The researcher2 user is part of the research_team group.

You must check the permissions for all files in the directory, including any hidden files, to make sure that permissions align with the authorization that should be given.
When it doesn't, you must change the permissions.

Task 1. Check file and directory details

-Navigate to the projects directory.
researcher2@a66412e02209:~$ cd Projects/
researcher2@a66412e02209:~/projects$ 

-List the contents and permissions of the projects directory.
researcher2@a66412e02209:~/projects$ ls -l








-Check whether any hidden files exist in the projects directory.
researcher2@a66412e02209:~/projects$ ls -la

Task  2. Change file permissions
-Check whether any files in the projects directory have write permissions for the owner type of other.
researcher2@a66412e02209:~/projects$ ls -l

-Change the permissions of the file identified in the previous step so that the owner type of other doesn’t have write permissions.
researcher2@a66412e02209:~/projects$ chmod o-w project_k.txt

-The file project_m.txt is a restricted file and should not be readable or writable by the group or other; only the user should have these permissions on this file. List the contents and permissions of the current directory and check if the group has read or write permissions.
researcher2@a66412e02209:~/projects$ ls -la

-Use the chmod command to change permissions of the project_m.txt file so that the group doesn’t have read or write permissions.
researcher2@a66412e02209:~/projects$ chmod g-r project_m.txt

Task 3. Change file permissions on a hidden file

-Check the permissions of the hidden file .project_x.txt and answer the question that follows.
researcher2@a66412e02209:~/projects$ ls -la


-Change the permissions of the file .project_x.txt so that both the user and the group can read, but not write to, the file.
researcher2@a66412e02209:~/projects$chmod u-w,g+r,g-w .project_x.txt

Task 4. Change directory permissions
-Check the permissions of the drafts directory and answer the following question.
researcher2@a66412e02209:~/projects$ls -l

-Remove the execute permission for the group from the drafts directory.

researcher2@a66412e02209:~/projects$chmod g-x drafts
