## Introduction
In this session, we will use Linux commands to configure authorization.

Authorization is the concept of granting access to specific resources in a system. 
It's important because without authorization any user could access and modify all files belonging to other users or system files. 
This would certainly be a security risk.

### Scenario
Scenario
In this scenario, you must examine and manage the permissions on the files in the /home/researcher2/projects directory for the researcher2 user.

The researcher2 user is part of the research_team group.

You must check the permissions for all files in the directory, including any hidden files, to make sure that permissions align with the authorization that should be given.
When it doesn't, you must change the permissions.
